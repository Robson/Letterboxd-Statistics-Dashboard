# Letterboxd Statistics Dashboard
A work-in-progress C# application for generating a webpage that shows statistics for your watched films on Letterboxd

## Testers

I am interested in testers for this. You would be an ideal candidate if:

 * You have logged hundreds/thousands of films on Letterboxd.
 * You're happy to share your exported data with me.
 * You're interested in seeing statistics for your watched films.
 * You'd be happy to provide feedback.

If that's you: get in touch via raising an issue in this repository.
